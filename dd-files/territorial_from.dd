$ontext
This dd file is used to remove ets caps from a particular year. It also prevents any import or exports of Traded-Emission-ETS from that year.

It expects to be called in the form:

$batincldue territorial_from YEAR

$offtext

$eolcom #
$OFFEPS # If we something to zero we mean to delete it
$ONMULTI # This allows us to overwrite previously set items

scalar territorial_emissions_from_year /%1/;

COM_BNDNET('UK',ALLYEAR,'GHG-ETS-NO-IAS-NET','ANNUAL','FX')
  $(YEARVAL(ALLYEAR) >= territorial_emissions_from_year) = 0; # Delete constraints on the ETS on and after the year

COM_BNDNET('UK',ALLYEAR,'Traded-Emission-ETS','ANNUAL','FX')
  $(YEARVAL(ALLYEAR) >= territorial_emissions_from_year) = EPS; # Don't allow any trading from that year

#{__FILE__}

This takes a list of cases and creates the run files that GAMS needs to 
use to execute them.

Usage:
ruby #{__FILE__} <destination_folder_for_run_files> <name_of_file_containing_cases> <name_of_run_file_template>

Where:
destination_folder_for_run_files - optional, default this folder, each row in the list of cases will become a run file in that folder
name_of_file_containing_cases    - optional, default cases.tsv, list of each case, where the first column is the name of the case, and remaining columns are #                                    scenarios to use in this case.
name_of_run_file_template - optional, the name of the template run file. Default is run-file-template.erb in the same folder as this script
END
